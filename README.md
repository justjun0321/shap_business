[Shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) is a Python package developed by [Scott Lundberg](https://github.com/slundberg). It's a great tool to do machine learning model explanation using different visualization.

I made this repository to share my edit based on the code from Shap to add parameters that allow you to add specific features in your plot using same shap package.
